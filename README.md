# Aquaponic-Structure
Chaminade College School aquaponic structure wireless management system

My high school had an aquaponic structure and one teacher asked me to create a system so that it could be monitored from his phone.
Using an arduino and a few sensors which he deemed to be necessary to making sure that the fish survive and Googles Firebase Database
I was able to create a local android app for him to view from anywhere.
